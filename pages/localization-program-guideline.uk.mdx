# Localization Program Guideline

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

In the process of **letting TON become the most successful Blockchain**, how to let Tact docs be more understandable to people around the world is also an important issue to resolve, that's why we need localization, and we're **glad** you're here ready to participate in.

<br />

<Callout emoji="üí°">
  **TON X TownSquare localization program**

This system **TON X TownSquare localization program** was designed by :\
 [**TownSquare**](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ) one of the closest partners of **TON**.

```
We commit ourselves to making an open infrastructure for multilingual community collaboration to **make TON get into a better phrase**, which includes:

1. **Suitable for multilingual communities**
2. **Automate development, integration, and deployment**
3. **Decoupling the roles of developer, translator, and verifier**
4. **Community contribution incentive**

  **...**

It's not just some project for only one language user, our goal is **for the global developer ecosystem**.
```

</Callout>

## Roles

Here are the **roles** you can be in the system :

- **Proofreader**
- **Translator** ( in-house or community )

Next, we'll have some specific guides about roles you wanna get into.

Our localization project is running on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/tact-docs).

  **IMPORTANT**

Before you start contributing, **read the guidelines below**! They will help you ensure the level of standardization and quality that will make the review process much faster.

## side-by-side mode

All these works are based on **side-by-side** mode in Crowdin Editor, if you don't know how to get into this, click a file you wanna start work, on the top right of the page, you can see¬†Editor¬†view button, we choose **side-by-side** mode, which will make¬†editor¬†more clear.
![side-by-side mode](public/localizationProgramGuideline/side-by-side.png)

</Callout>

### Proofreader

As a **Proofreader**, the files that have a **blue progress bar** are you gonna work in.
![proofread step1](public/localizationProgramGuideline/proofread-step1.png)
Click one of the files, you'll¬†get into¬†an editing¬†interface.

#### Let's start contribute.

1. First of all, we should make your workspace more suitable for work:

Make sure you're in [**side by side mode**](#side-by-side-mode), then let's find out which lines of translations need to be proofread, you can see there is a **filter** button on the **right** of Search in file input, let's choose **Not Approved** option.
![proofread filter](public/localizationProgramGuideline/proofread-filter.png)

2. Great, we're ready to start work now, here are the rules you should follow:
   - select a string that has a **blue cube icon** on left, which means it's translated but hasn't been proofread, check it carefully:
     - if it's all **right**, click the ‚òëÔ∏è button on top.
     - if it's **not right**, just ignore it, go to the next line.

![proofread approved](public/localizationProgramGuideline/proofread-approved.png)

<Callout type="info" emoji="‚ÑπÔ∏è">
  **You also have the right to check lines which already been proofread**:

```
1. set a filter option to **Approved**.
2. if there is an approved line that still has issues, you can **click the same ‚òëÔ∏è button** on top, to set this line's state back to need proofreading.
```

</Callout>

<br />

3. Well done! if you wanna go to the next file in editor mode, just **click the file name** on the top, you can see a pop-up window, click the file name you will be transported to that file, and continue your proofread travel.

#### We also provide you with a great function:

You can **see the fruits of your labor in time**.Every content approved by proofreaders will be deployed in a preview website in one hour. Check [**our repo**](https://github.com/TownSquareXYZ/tact-docs/pulls), you'll find **preview** link in newest pr.

### Translator

The **translator** decides what readers can see in this doc, so make sure to translate docs faithfulness and expressiveness, in another way, **make your translation close to the original meaning and also as simple and understandable as possible**.

Our mission is to make the **blue progress bar** of the file reach 100%.

#### Let's start translate.

Don't be stressed about this, you can ask for help from **AI** and **other translators**, follow these guides to help you do better:

Click files that haven't been 100% translated.
![translator select](public/localizationProgramGuideline/translator-select.png)

Again, after you get into the editor, make sure you're in [**side by side mode**](#side-by-side-mode):

1. To list lines that need to be translated. you can see there is a **filter** button on the right of Search in file input, let's choose¬†**Untranslated**.
   ![translator filter](public/localizationProgramGuideline/translator-filter.png)

2. You can see the whole page has been separated to four-part:

   - The **top left** one is where you **input your translation**. According to Source string, you should input the correct translation to its right input.
   - The **bottom left** one¬†is the preview of the translated file. Make sure to **keep the translated format** as same as the original one, this is also **important**.
   - The **bottom right** one are the **suggestion translations** from crowdin. If there is a right translation in there, you can just click that translate, and crowdin will input that into the target translation.

     <Callout emoji="üí°">
      **Notice**

      it's convenient, but be aware, they are **not always right**, so be careful when you use this function, especially when the Source¬†string include a link or some other path, **don't let suggest translations change the links**.

     </Callout>

3. Once you think your translation is done or wanna take a break, **click Save button** on the top, your current translation will update to the project, waiting for proofreading.
   ![translator save](public/localizationProgramGuideline/translator-save.png)

4. Congrats, now you know how to work like a translator, if you wanna go to the next file in the editor, just **click the file name** on the top, and¬†it will have a pop-up window, click¬†the file name¬†you will be transported¬†to that file, enjoy it!
